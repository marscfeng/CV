  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the efficacy of single versus dual
	extraventricular drain (EVD) use in intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),
	with and without thrombolytic therapy. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis
	of seven patients with dual bilateral EVDs from two multicenter trials
	involving 100 patients with IVH, and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage
	(ICH) volume &lt;30 ml requiring emergency external ventricular drainage.
	Seven "control" patients with single catheters were matched by IVH
	volume and distribution and treatment assignment. Head CT scans were
	obtained daily during intraventricular injections for quantitative
	determination of IVH volume. RESULTS: Median [min-max] age of the
	14 subjects was 56 [40-73] years. Median duration of EVD was 7.9
	days (single catheter group) versus 12.2 days (dual catheter group)
	(P = 0.34). Baseline median IVH volume was not significantly different
	between groups (75.4 ml [22.4-105.1]-single EVD vs. 84.5 ml [42.0-132.0]-dual
	EVD; P = 0.28). Comparing the change in IVH volume on time-matched
	CT scans during dual EVD use, the median decrease in IVH volume in
	dual catheter patients was significantly larger (52.1 [31.7-81.1]
	ml) versus single catheter patients (34.5 [13.1-73.9] ml) (P = 0.004).
	There was a trend to greater decrease in IVH volume during dual EVD
	use in both rt-PA (P = 0.9) and placebo-treated (P = 0.11) subgroups.
	CONCLUSION: The decision to place dual EVDs is generally reserved
	for large IVH (>40 ml) with casting and mass effect. The use of dual
	simultaneous catheters may increase clot resolution with or without
	adjunctive thrombolytic therapy.}

  title = {Minimally invasive evacuation of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage

  journal = {J Neurosurg},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Object Catheter-based evacuation is a novel surgical approach for
	the treatment of brain hemorrhage. The object of this study was to
	evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound in combination with
	recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) delivered through
	a microcatheter directly into spontaneous intraventricular (IVH)
	or intracerebral (ICH) hemorrhage in humans. Methods Thirty-three
	patients presenting to the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington,
	with ICH and IVH were screened between November 21, 2008, and July
	13, 2009, for entry into this study. Entry criteria included the
	spontaneous onset of intracranial hemorrhage ³ 25 ml and/or IVH producing
	ventricular obstruction. Nine patients (6 males and 3 females, with
	an average age of 63 years [range 38-83 years]) who met the entry
	criteria consented to participate and were entered into the trial.
	A ventricular drainage catheter and an ultrasound microcatheter were
	stereotactically delivered together, directly into the IVH or ICH.
	Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and 24 hours of continuous
	ultrasound were delivered to the clot. Gravity drainage was performed.
	In patients with IVHs, 3 mg of rt-PA was injected; in patients with
	intraparenchymal hemorrhages, 0.9 mg of rt-PA was injected. The rt-PA
	was delivered in 3 doses over 24 hours. Results All patients had
	significant volume reductions in the treated hemorrhage. The mean
	percentage volume reduction after 24 hours of therapy, as determined
	on CT and compared with pretreatment stability scans, was 59 ± 5%
	(mean ± SEM) for ICH and 45.1 ± 13% for IVH (1 patient with ICH was
	excluded from analysis because of catheter breakage). There were
	no intracranial infections and no significant episodes of rebleeding
	according to clinical or CT assessment. One death occurred by 30
	days after admission. Clinical improvements as determined by a decrease
	in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were demonstrated
	at 30 days after treatment in 7 of 9 patients. The rate of hemorrhage
	lysis was compared between 8 patients who completed treatment, and
	patient cohorts treated for IVH and ICH using identical doses of
	rt-PA and catheter drainage but without the ultrasound (courtesy
	of the MISTIE [Minimally Invasive Surgery plus T-PA for Intracerebral
	Hemorrhage Evacuation] and CLEAR II [Clot Lysis Evaluating Accelerated
	Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage II] studies). Compared
	with the MISTIE and CLEAR data, the authors observed a faster rate
	of lysis during treatment for IVH and ICH in the patients treated
	with sonolysis plus rt-PA versus rt-PA alone. Conclusions Lysis and
	drainage of spontaneous ICH and IVH with a reduction in mass effect
	can be accomplished rapidly and safely through sonothrombolysis using
	stereotactically delivered drainage and ultrasound catheters via
	a bur hole. A larger clinical trial with catheters specifically designed
	for brain blood clot removal is warranted.}
