\doublespacing
After receiving my Master's degree in Biostatistics, becoming a consultant for the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Consulting Center (JHBC) on various projects, and 3 years in my PhD program of Biostatistics, I believe I understand the requirements and day-to-day life of an academic statistician.  I do not, however, understand the requirements of a data scientist in an industry setting.  An internship in an industry position at \company will provide me insights of the roles of data scientists, engineers, and researchers in a large-scale industrial corporation.

My primary interest is research in health care and \company has a global impact on health.  Moreover, \company produces a large number of scanners used for imaging.  As I have worked on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and focus on X-ray computed tomography (CT), I believe I can provide unique tools to image processing and development.  Although neuroimaging is my primary focus, I have performed data cleaning and large-scale data analysis and have extensive experience with programming and pipeline development.   These skills cross many disciplines and I have found that nearly all operations can be more efficient and reliable if automated methods replace any manual steps.

Overall, I think \company is a leader in a number of fields, particularly in health care.  Working on projects that can directly help healthcare researchers and patients is ideal for my career, and an internship at \company provides the foundation for long-term, large-scale impact.
