I work on neuroimaging.  I organize, process, and analyze large-scale neuroimaging data sets from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with stroke, to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scans of patients with various diseases, positron emission tomography (PET) scans of patients with tuberculosis, and have analyzed functional MRI (fMRI) of children with ADHD, autism, and no known neuropathology on task-based and resting state scans.  

After receiving my Master's degree in Biostatistics, becoming a consultant for the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Consulting Center (JHBC) on various projects, and 3 years in my PhD program of Biostatistics, I believe I understand the requirements and day-to-day life of an academic statistician.  I do not, however, understand the requirements of a neuroimaging researcher in an industry setting.  An internship in an industry position at \company will provide me insights into the roles I would have in that setting.

Although neuroimaging is my primary focus, I have performed data cleaning and large-scale data analysis and have extensive experience with programming and pipeline development.   These skills cross many disciplines and I have found that nearly all operations can be more efficient and reliable if automated methods replace any manual steps.

Overall, I think \company is a leader in a number of fields, particularly in health care.  Working on projects that can directly help health care researchers and patients is ideal for my career, and an internship at \company provides the foundation for long-term, large-scale impact.
